          My name is Brian Sostek, and I'm a sophomore studying computer science at the
           <a target="_blank" class="textlink" href="https://www.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a>
          in Pittsburgh, PA. <br> I was born and raised in a town about 40 minutes outside of Philadelphia named Blue Bell,
           and attended <a target="_blank" class="textlink" href="http://www.wsdweb.org">Wissahickon High School</a>. At Wissahickon, I made
           some amazing friends, but more importantly, I figured out what I was interested in.
