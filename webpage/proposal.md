**Website Portfolio Proposal**

This is the location of my new and improved website, which I hope to replace with my old website at the link
of https://briansostek.github.io. This site features ugly and outdated looking styling. I want to improve it
using my newfound CSS and HTML skills. My website will mostly feature the same content but will look more
professional.

Here are my assets for my site:
* Background Image of my friends and I on a mountaintop.
* Logo I designed when making my last site.
* Gallery images (9)
