    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
    <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
    <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
  <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
  <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
  <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
  <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
      an ordered list</li>
</ol>
<h2>Inline Elements</h2>

<p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
phrase.</p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

<p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

<p>Regards,<br/>
